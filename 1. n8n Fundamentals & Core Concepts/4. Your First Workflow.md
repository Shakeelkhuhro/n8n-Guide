# Building Your First Workflow: A Simple "Hello World" Example

Let's embark on building your first n8n workflow. This "Hello World" example will introduce you to the fundamental building blocks of n8n and how they interact. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to create a simple workflow, add nodes, connect them, and execute the workflow to produce a desired output. This foundational knowledge will be crucial as we move on to more complex automation scenarios.

## Creating Your First Workflow

To begin, you'll need an n8n instance running. Whether you're using Docker, a cloud platform, or a local installation, the process for creating a new workflow is the same.

* **Access the n8n Interface**: Open your web browser and navigate to the address where your n8n instance is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5678`).
* **Create a New Workflow**: Click the "+" button in the top left corner of the interface. This will create a new, blank workflow. You can also select "New workflow" from the menu.
* **Name Your Workflow**: Give your workflow a descriptive name, such as "Hello World Workflow." This will help you easily identify it later. Click on the workflow name at the top of the screen (it will initially say "Untitled") and enter the new name.

## Adding Nodes

Nodes are the core building blocks of any n8n workflow. Each node performs a specific task, such as receiving data, transforming data, or sending data to another service. For our "Hello World" workflow, we'll use two nodes: a **Start** node and a **Set** node.

### The Start Node

Every n8n workflow needs a Start node. This node acts as the entry point for the workflow. It doesn't perform any specific action itself, but it's required to initiate the workflow execution.

* **Adding the Start Node**: The Start node is usually added by default when you create a new workflow. If it's not there, you can add it by clicking the "+" button on the canvas and selecting "Start."
* **Configuring the Start Node**: The Start node typically doesn't require any configuration. It simply triggers the workflow when executed.

### The Set Node

The Set node allows you to define data that will be used in your workflow. In this case, we'll use it to set the "Hello World" message.

* **Adding the Set Node**: Click the "+" button on the canvas, search for "Set," and select the Set node.
* **Connecting the Nodes**: Drag a connection line from the output of the Start node to the input of the Set node. This establishes the data flow between the two nodes.
* **Configuring the Set Node**:

  * Click on the Set node to open its configuration panel.
  * In the "Add Value" section, select "String" from the dropdown menu.
  * Enter `message` in the "Name" field. This will be the name of the data field we're creating.
  * Enter `Hello World!` in the "Value" field. This is the actual message we want to set.

## Executing the Workflow

Now that we've created and configured our workflow, it's time to execute it and see the results.

* **Click the "Execute Workflow" Button**: This button is located in the top right corner of the n8n interface.
* **Inspect the Results**: After the workflow executes, you'll see the execution results displayed below the canvas. Click on the Set node in the execution results to view the data that was set. You should see a `message` field with the value `Hello World!`.

## Understanding the Data Flow

The data in n8n workflows flows from node to node through connections. In our example, the Start node initiates the workflow, and then the Set node creates a data object containing the `message` field with the value `Hello World!`. This data is then available for use in subsequent nodes.

### Data Structure

n8n uses a JSON-like data structure to represent data within workflows. Each node receives data as an array of items, where each item is a JSON object. In our "Hello World" example, the Set node creates a single item with a single property:

```json
[
  {
    "json": {
      "message": "Hello World!"
    }
  }
]
```

The `json` property contains the actual data that was set in the Set node. This structure might seem a bit complex for such a simple example, but it's designed to handle more complex data transformations and integrations.

## Practice Activities

* **Modify the Message**: Change the value of the `message` field in the Set node to something else, such as `Hello n8n!`. Execute the workflow and verify that the output reflects the change.
* **Add Another Set Node**: Add a second Set node after the first one. In the second Set node, create a new field called `greeting` and set its value to an expression that combines the `message` field from the first Set node with a greeting, such as:
  `The message is: {{$json.message}}`
  Execute the workflow and inspect the results. (This introduces a very basic expression, which will be covered in more detail later.)
* **Introduce an Error**: Remove the connection between the Start node and the Set node. Execute the workflow. What happens? Why? (This helps understand the importance of connections for data flow.)

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This lesson walks through creating your first workflow in n8n â€” a simple "Hello World" example. You learn how to:

* Set up a new workflow using the n8n interface.
* Use two basic nodes: `Start` (trigger) and `Set` (to define output).
* Execute the workflow and inspect the resulting data.
* Understand the flow of data between nodes and how it's structured in JSON.
* Practice modifying and expanding the workflow to reinforce learning.

This foundational knowledge sets the stage for building more advanced automations using n8nâ€™s powerful node-based system.
